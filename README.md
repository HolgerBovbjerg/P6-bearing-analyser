This repository is part of a 6th semester bachelor project at Aalborg University on the study programme Electronics and IT. The project is made by group 643 in the spring 2020.


The DSP project can be found under "Final_project/Bearing_analyzer"

The code written by the group can be seen in these files:

  * main.c
  * I2C_funcs.c

In main.c it is only the code between these lines that are written by the group:

//------------	START OF CODE WRITTEN BY GR643	---------------------------------------------

//------------	END OF CODE WRITTEN BY GR643	---------------------------------------------

The rest of the files are libraries and system files used by the DSP
